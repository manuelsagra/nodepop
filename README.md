# Nodepop API

A node.js REST API for selling second hand stuff. Right now it only shows preloaded items to registered users.

##Â Installation

You need a recent [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installation to make it work. 

Clone or download the repository and install dependencies executing:

```shell
npm i
```

You also need to have [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) installed. You can [download the binaries for your operating system](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center?jmp=homepage#community) (Windows, Mac, Linux) and then execute this in the directory after decompression:

```shell
mkdir data/db
./bin/mongod --dbpath ./data/db --directoryperdb
```

To insert some sample data in the database, go back to this project directory and execute:

```shell
npm run installdb
```

You can audit the code anytime running [eslint](https://eslint.org/) with the following command:

```shell
npm run lint
```

## Starting the server

To start the server you should execute:

```shell
npm run start
```

If you want to start the server with debug info you need to execute:

```shell
npm run debug
```

In both modes a cluster is started with as many nodes as the number of CPU cores. Once started, you can see the documentation and a sample app pointing your browser to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).

## API documentation

Error messages are available either in *english* (default) or *spanish*. To use one of this languages, you can use the `lang` query parameter or the browser standard `Accept-Language` header and the appropiate ISO code (`en`, `es`).
